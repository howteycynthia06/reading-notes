### What is Version Control? ###
* Version Control is a system that tracks changes to files over time so you can:

✅ Save versions of your work

It records snapshots of your project. If you make a mistake, you can go back to a previous version.

✅ Collaborate with others

Multiple people can work on the same project without overwriting each other’s work.

✅ See who changed what and when

It keeps a history of edits, who made them, and why.

The most common version control system is Git.
In short:

Version Control helps you manage, track, and organize changes in your projects — especially code — safely and efficiently.

### What is cloning in Git? ###
* In Git, cloning means making a full copy of a remote repository (like one on GitHub) onto your local computer.

When you clone a repository, Git:

Downloads all files

Copies the project history (all commits)

Sets up a connection to the remote repo so you can pull updates and push your changes.

### What is the command to track and stage files? ###
* Stage a specific file
* Stage all changes in the current directory
* Stage everything in the entire project (tracked + untracked)

### What is the command to take a snapshot of your changed files? ###
* The command to take a snapshot of your changed files is:

👉 git commit

Example:

git commit -m "Your descriptive message here"


This records a snapshot of everything you’ve staged.

### What is the command to send your changed files to Github? ###
* The command to send your committed changes to GitHub is:

👉 git push

Example:

git push origin main


(Use main or master, depending on your branch name.)
