### What is the purpose of CSS?
* CSS’s purpose is to make web pages visually appealing, organized, and adaptable, while keeping the design separate from the content.
### What are the three ways to insert CSS into your project?
1. Inline CSS

* CSS is written directly inside an HTML element using the style attribute.
2. Internal (Embedded) CSS

* CSS is written inside a < style> tag in the head of the HTML file.
3. Write an example of a CSS rule that would give all < p> elements red text.
* p {
  color: red;
}
* p {
  color: red;
}
